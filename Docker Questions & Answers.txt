Docker: 
  Docker is a software platform that allows you to build, test, and deploy applications quickly.
  Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly.

Container:
  * A way to package application with all the necessary dependencies and configuration 
  * It is portable (can be easily shared and moved)
  * Makes development and deployment more efficient.

Image: 
A read-only template used to create containers. It contains the application code, libraries, dependencies, and environment variables. Images are built from a Docker file.

Docker file:
A Docker file is a simple text file that contains the commands a user could call to assemble an image.

Docker Compose:  
Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications.

Container Orchestration: Tools like Docker Compose, Kubernetes, and Docker Swarm manage and scale containerized applications, handling deployment, scaling, and load balancing.

Docker Engine: The runtime that enables the creation and management of Docker containers. It consists of a server, REST API, and command-line interface.

Docker Secrets: Securely manage and store sensitive data, such as passwords or API keys, used by Docker services.

Docker Health Checks: Monitor the health of containers and ensure that they are running correctly by running periodic checks.

Docker Compose Overrides: Customize and extend docker-compose.yml files for different environments using override files.
